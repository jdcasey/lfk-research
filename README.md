# Reasoning for Informed Decisions (RID) - LFK

RID is a citizen research / reasoning organization aiming at collecting, curating, and advocating for policies that will improve the lives of our residents.

## Values

We strive to help our government make informed decisions, assuming the welfare of the majority of residents is the criteria for a good policy. Our research AND position papers will be sourced / cited and publicly available for any to read.

**Facts matter, and it is critical to show your work.**

## Goals

* Advocate for the best outcome for most residents
* Conduct research around policy questions
* Curate research from citizen contributors
* Marshal background research to provide facts and solid arguments before our local government

* Provide advocacy in Facebook comments / other social media venues
* Advocate for RID positions in social media, newspaper op-eds, etc.
* Collect research on specific questions underlying policies being considered, curated topically
